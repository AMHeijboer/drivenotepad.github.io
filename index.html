<p>The app is hosted <a href="https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/">free on github</a>, and Google Drive API requests are also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10313416/2399799">fulfilled for free</a>.  This means it costs nothing to keep the app up and running, and hence it can be provided to users for free. Yay!</p>

<p>The editor itself is an instance of the <a href="http://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/">ace.js poject</a> (including the css). The file history viewer uses <a href="http://snowtide.com/jsdifflib">jsdifflib</a> for diffing (the diff-chaining and UI are custom built). The menu icons are from <a href="http://modernuiicons.com/">modernuiicons.com</a>. the shake animation is from <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">daneden.me</a>, all other CSS is custom "designed".  JavaScript keybinding use <a href="https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster">keymaster.js</a>.</p>

<p><b>Mar 2016.</b> Drive Notepad has moved from <code>appspot.com</code> to <code>github.io</code>.  It has also undergone a major refresh. The new version should have improved stability, speed and useability, however for the first few days there may be some issues that need resolving. As always, please provide feedback in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/107691649945880497995">Google+ community</a>. </p>

<p><b>Aug 2015. !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!</b> After August 2016 you will no longer be able to use Google Drive as a simple web-server for HTML/JS/CSS/images etc (see this <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/deprecating-web-hosting-support-in.html">Google blog post</a>).

Your files will not disappear from your Google Drive - you will still be able to access them via the usual web interface and/or desktop sync program, and you will still be able to open them with Drive Notepad (or other similar 3rd party apps), however you will no longer be able to use Google Drive + Drive Notepad as a means of quickly building publicly visible websites. In terms of replacements, there may not be anything quite as easy/free/simple out there, but there are a large number of alternatives with varying strengths. 
One option is to create a repository with a <code>gh-pages</code> branch on github and then access it at <code>your_username.github.io/your_repository_name</code>. This is how drivenotepad itself is now being served (although it is a github "organisation" rather than a user). If you know of a better alternative please comment on the <a href="https://plus.google.com/108192375095500160194/posts/ZkW3GwcHyoA">Google+ version of this announcement</a> for others to see.</p>

<h3><a iclass="anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>How do I uninstall Drive Notepad?</b> It is not enough to uninstall the Chrome Webstore app, you need to remove Drive Notepad from your Google Drive account - see Google's instruction <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2523073">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>How do I log out of Drive Notepad?</b>
If you are logged in to your Google account you will have access to Drive Notepad. Logging out of your Google account will log you out of Drive Notepad in so far as you will not be able to open new pages with Drive Notepad. However, to fully log out you you must close all Drive Notepad tabs in your browser. If you want to prevent Drive Notepad from ever being able to access your files again then see <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2523073">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>It doesn't work! Huh?!</b>
There are many web browsers and operating systems in existence, but only a very limited number have been used during testing, and fewer still were found to give the fully correct experience.  If possible, use Google Chrome. If that's not an option, try Firefox or Microsof's Edge browser.  If you really are restricted to some other browser, then unfortunately it is unlikely that Drive Notepad will work for you, but please post in the Google+ community to see whether there is anything that can be done.  Sometime the problem is not with the browser but with a virus, popup/ad blocker or extension.  To test this, try opening your browser with extensions disabled ("incognito" mode in Chrome), and try it on a separate computer.  If the problem persists please report it in the Google+ community.
</p>

<p><b>My non-English characters are mangled.</b>
In many cases if you upload a non-English document to Google Drive and open it with Drive Notepad you will not see the correct characters even though you will be able to type new content using non-English characters as expected.
This is because your original document would have been saved using some sort of compact localised character set, but Drive Notepad had no way of knowing this and assumed it was UTF-8 encoded (as it does with everything else). When using UTF-8 there are tens of thousands of characters that can be displayed (including hieroglyphics and maths symbols), but only the basic Latin alphabet is compactly encoded with each letter taking up 1 byte. 
DM is a native English speaker in the UK so never has to worry about these things himself, normally, but he appreciates that he is in the minority. Having said that there are currently no plans to improve upon Drive Notepad's simple UTF-8 support - sorry. Also, there are currently no plans for adding additional languages in Drive Notepad (but I don't imagine this will be a problem for most users given how little language is used).
</p>

<p><b>How secure is Drive Notepad?</b>
DM is not a specialist in security, but Drive Notepad is likely to be reasonably secure as it only consists of the code running in your browser, i.e. there is no customized backend server or database with users' information.  The application is served from github, and API requests are made directly to Google, using the Google's own JavaScript library.
</p>

<p><b>Can I go back to a previous version of a file?</b> Yes. Yes, you can. Version control is very much part of Google Drive, and Drive Notepad in theory should never mess this up. See Google's help <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2409045">here</a>. Drive Notepad now has a tool built in that lets you view the history of a file in an interactive way - click the history button in the file tab or use the shorcut ctrl-H. Be gentle with the history tool as it's still under development and may still have the odd bug (it won't mess up your file but it might not yet show you what you need)!</p>
